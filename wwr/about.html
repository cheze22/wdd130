            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1995 by river enthusiasts Jake Morrison and Sarah Chen, Wild Rapids Rafting began as a small
                family operation with just two rafts and a dream to share their passion for white water adventures. Over
                nearly three decades, we have grown into one of the region's most trusted rafting companies, having
                safely guided over 50,000 adventurers down some of the most spectacular rivers in the area. Our
                commitment to safety, environmental stewardship, and creating exceptional experiences has earned us
                numerous awards and the loyalty of countless returning customers.</p>
