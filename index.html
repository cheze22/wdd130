        <p>Hi everyone , my name is Cristhian Nefi Dorado Aguilar. I grew up in La Paz, Bolivia. I come from a big
            family, and
            being in the middle of the birth order taught me a lot about balance and responsibility. One of the main
            challenges I
            faced while growing up was learning how to deal with burnout and finding better ways to organize my life.
            Over time, I
            learned to set limits, plan better, and focus on what really matters.

            A leader I admire deeply is Jesus Christ. I value His ability to love, serve, and inspire others with
            humility and
            purpose. His example motivates me to become a better person and to lead by serving those around me.</p>
